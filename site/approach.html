    <h1><i>How confident are you when you say 'Jamaal Charles's expected fantasy points this week is 10.41'?</i></h1><br>
      <p>Some players score less on average, but are more reliable-they score similar score every time they play.
Some players score more on average, but they can score 0 points on one week and then 30+ points on the following week.
Which one would you enroll in your team? But in the first place, did any prediction sites ever told you which side your players are in?

    <h2><b>Our Approach</b></h2><br>
      <p><i>Simple and Transparent</i> - If your friend come and say 'I think Aaron Rodgers's point will be 20' but never tell you why he thinks so, would you believe it?Okay, let's assume he predicted pretty close. But where is the fun when you listen to someone and adjust your team without knowing why he said so?</p>
      <p>We've analyzed the relationship between a player's past five week's stats(rushing yds/tds, pashing yds/tds, and fumbles lost for RB) using simple linear regression. That's it. Our goal was not to make something that makes the most accurate prediction to the last decimal points, but something usual, non-statistician fantasy football players can understand. You can see our recommendations, understand the logic and finally choose someone else because you might be more interested in some other decision making factors. But we wanted you to at least understand why we suggested this player.</p><br>
      <p><i>Expert Opinions, Vegas Odds</i> - Our linear regression gives a point predictions. ESPN will tell you what they think when you visit their website. CBS and FFToday will do the same thing. Vegas odds will also tell you something about player's performance.  They compete to make more accurate predictions. In Waiver Coach, they don't compete. We will tell you who says what. Predictions for some players will fall in narrow range for all sources, for some players everyone can have different thoughts. Waiver Coach will show you distribution, it's up to you to make the final decision.</p><br>

    <h2><b>Personalized for You and Your Team (not implemented yet)</b></h2>
      <p>Football is a team sport. Some players do better when they team up with other players.
Did you know DeMarco Murray scores 2.6 points more on average when teamed up with Allen Barbre?
Our next goal is to incorporate correlations between players into our predictions.
Remember, we are suggesting this player just for your team, not for everybody.
