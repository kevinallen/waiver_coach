### Running the site locally
If you have PHP 5 on your local machine, you can start a PHP web server from the command line. After changing to the site directory, use this command:

```Shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You can then navigate to the url [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html).
