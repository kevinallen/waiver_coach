# Waiver Coach
Waiver Coach is an application that will help fantasy football coaches find the best waiver wire pickups with little effort.

The application will coalesce information about your fantasy league with information about player statistics, expert picks, and simulated games using machine learning to identify the best available players for your team.

The first step is to sign in with your Yahoo credentials to sync your league to the app.

### TODO
[] Connect to Yahoo API and download team details
 - Need to refresh every time app opens
 - store league data in CouchDB
